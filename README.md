# How-Invest-Monet-Effectively-in-Stocks
This work seeks to develop a portfolio that maximizes the expected returns and minimize the risk as much as possible and determines how one should invest a sum of money
when different stocks are available, each with some unpredictability in how their price will fluctuate over time.
The Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT, Markowitz Portfolio
Theory) is a mathematical framework for analyzing this
kind of situation. In this project, the Monte Carlo Simulation Method has been implemented using Python with the
objective to find a portfolio that gives maximum profit or
minimum risk. To do so, the portfolio of 4 stocks, be more
precise “Apple”, “Amazon”, “Microsoft” and “Netflix”
have been considered. In order to get the data of prices
of the above-mentioned stocks “Yahoo Finance” platform
has been used. From the randomly simulated portfolios,
the Efficient Frontier has been created and the Sharpe Ratio has been used for calculating the risk-adjusted return.
